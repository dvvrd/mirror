This is a very useful tool if you want to trace some user actions to reproduce their bugs. 
Given a log in a strict format this tool will parse out mouse and keyboard actions and reproduce it with WinAPI functions (X Server manipulation is also planned).
Currently accepts logs in QReal format (http://github.com/qreal/qreal).
